        <h1>Happy April Fools!</h1>
        You calendar is correct to begin with. No need to worry.

        Update: This was an April Fools prank. All calendars downloaded/subscribed from CUED Calendar Assistant preserves the timezone properties of department's official calendars, and thus will follow daylight savings. Changing your system timezone also has no effect on the event times of lectures and labs.
